# What is a conditional?

-"controls the flow of execution"
    --> determines path/direction based on whatever factors/conditions are established
    --> if, else, elsif statements
    
        if (condition to be met)
            code to run if condition is met
        elsif
            code to run if if-condition is not met
        else
            code to run if conditions not met
        end
